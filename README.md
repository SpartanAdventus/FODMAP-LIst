2. **Read ingredient labels carefully:** Many packaged products contain high FODMAP ingredients like onion powder, garlic powder, and inulin. Always check labels for these.
3. **Reintroduce FODMAPs gradually:** After completing the elimination phase, you should reintroduce higher FODMAP foods one at a time to determine which ones cause symptoms.

This list is designed to help guide you in the elimination phase of the low FODMAP diet. Always consult with a healthcare provider or dietitian to ensure you're managing your condition appropriately.
